Data analysis and visualisation with ggplot2 of the Diamonds dataset

# Portfolio Project 6 - R - Diamonds dataset ggplot2 visualisation

Welcome to my sixth portfolio project. In this data analysis and visualisation project, I analyse and visualise the Diamonds dataset using the ggplot2 library.

**Project Guide**

The Diamonds dataset, which comes in-built with the ggplot2 library in R, is a popular dataset containing data on 53,940 round-cut diamonds, listing their prices, with attributes such as carat, colour, cut and clarity.

The visualised output of my first ggplot in the project:

The volume of the dataset with 50,000+ entries and the variety of attributes available make it a popular starting dataset for visualisation practice.

The visualised output of my second ggplot in the project:
